### This is a free access repository for the Coursera Specialization of Embedded
### Software Essentials to use in conjunction with the course1, the Introductio
### to Embedded Software and Development Environments.

### The repository is organized in multiple folders:
###      demos -> Materials to help you follow along with videos
###      assessments -> Materials used for assessments
###      assessments -> Materials used for assessments
###      assessments -> Materials used for assessments

1- We write a couple of functions that can analyze an array of unsigned char data items and report analytics on the 
- maximum, 
- minimum, 
- mean, and 
- median of the data set. 

In addition, you will need to:
- reorder this data set from large to small. 
- All statistics should be rounded down to the nearest integer. After analysis and sorting is done, you will need to print that data to the screen in nicely formatted presentation. You will need to submit a version controlled repository of these 3 files.
